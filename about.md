# About me

Hi there,
I’m a master’s student in artificial intelligence at Iran University of Science and Technology ([IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en)), under the supervision of [Prof. Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/).
My research interest primarily lies in the analysis and interpretability of NLP models.
