<p><span style="font-size: 19px"><em><strong>Hi there!</strong></em> </span> <br />
I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://ltl.science.uva.nl/">Language Technology Lab (LTL)</a>, University of Amsterdam, where I'm advised by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.monz/">Christof Monz</a>.
 My research interests in Natural Language Processing generally revolve around <strong>Multilinguality</strong> and <strong>Cross-lingual Transfer Learning</strong>, specifically for <strong>low-resource languages</strong>.
<br />I've got my masterâ€™s in artificial intelligence from <a href="http://www.iust.ac.ir/en">Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)</a> in March 2022.
 I was fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://pilehvar.github.io/">Mohammad Taher Pilehvar</a>.
 During this time, I was interested in <strong>Analyzing Contextual Embedding Spaces</strong> and <strong>Interpreting Language Models</strong>.
